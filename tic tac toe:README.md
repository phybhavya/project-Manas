this tic tac toe game is deisgned for every one.
at first player one should enter name. the player will be assigned "X". then player2 should enter thier name , the player will assign the character"0"
after that the board will be displayed in which every slot is numbered and player one will be given chance to start first. the player should enter the number where its character
is to be placed.and this will continue unless one of the player is able to make the series of their character in vertical ,horizontal or diagnol manner.
The code is dived into mainly 3 parts 
FIRST function is board which is architecture of the game or  how the tic-tac-toe  will be seen. it is done by basic print commands. Also two character tokens are used "x" and "0".And the numbers which are represented 
in the slots are formed by making character array known as space.
SECOND is place_character in this the working of game is designed which is basically taking inputs from the user and placing thier respective character with the number of slot they 
provided.
THIRD is winner  function is a boolean function which can be also decide the winner.For loops are used so if the player is able to make one of the series of thier characters in horizontal,
vertical or diagnol, then the function will return true and player will be declared as winner.
